## Guide

### Expo

This app is using Expo to make your development easier and faster.
Also it make easily publish testing app with using Expo.

For more informations, please check [Expo.dev](https://docs.expo.dev/).

### Configuration

You can set the name of the app, version, permissions, etc. through `app.json`.

https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/

### State/Storage

This app are using [Redux(toolkit)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management,
and [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) for persisting store's state when app reload.  
And also using [Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/) for data storage.

Here is an example case of getting stored data:

```ts
// state(redux)
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { RootState } from '../lib/redux/store';

// get user & token from redux
const { user, token } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth);
```

### Theme

The theme settings of the app can be changed in `theme.ts`.  
You can customize color schema, style of component, font style, and more.

- https://docs.nativebase.io/customizing-theme
- https://docs.nativebase.io/customizing-components
- https://docs.nativebase.io/utility-props#style-props
- https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes/

Regarding dark mode and light mode, basically, it automatically sets by user's enviroment.  
However, it is also possible to set them manually:

```ts
import { theme } from './theme';

const mode = useColorScheme();
// you can set `dark` or `light` instead of system mode
theme.config.initialColorMode = mode;
```

The color theme for the component will also be set automatically, but you can customize them manually:

```tsx
<View
  _light={{
    borderColor: 'light.border',
  }}
  _dark={{
    borderColor: 'dark.border',
  }}
/>
```
